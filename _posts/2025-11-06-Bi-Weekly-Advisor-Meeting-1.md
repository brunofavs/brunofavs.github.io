Last meeting, on the 24th of October, we concluded that it would be better to set bi-weekly deadlines to ensure that I didn't wander off too much in the vast world of RL and Robotics
and could ensure progress on my PhD problem. With this in mind, we agreed that it would be good to analyze some review papers on the fields of:

- Contact-Rich Robotics;
- Deep Reinforcement Learning;
- Model-based Reinforcement Learning.


I began my search on Scopus with the following search equation:
```
TITLE ( "Robo*" ) AND ( TITLE ( "contact" ) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "touch" ) ) 
AND PUBYEAR > 2022 AND PUBYEAR < 2026 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( DOCTYPE , "re" ) )
```

Which yielded 34 results. Amongst those, a particular one caught my eye, named **"A review on reinforcement learning for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks"** ([**DOI**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102517))
